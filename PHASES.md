  - [x] `cli.py` - Command-line interface
  - [x] `timeline.py` - Core timeline operations
- [x] `scripts/` directory with XFCE integration
  - [x] `hook-xfce-reload.sh` - Desktop reload functionality
- [x] `nix/` directory with NixOS configuration
  - [x] `rewind.nix` - Main NixOS module
  - [x] `example.nix` - Example configuration
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Updated `README.md`
  - [x] `PHASES.md` (this document)

### Core Features Implemented
- **Timeline Operations**:
  - `list` - List branches and snapshots
